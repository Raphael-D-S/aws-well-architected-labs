Amazon Aurora Global Database is designed for globally distributed applications, allowing a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS regions. It replicates your data with no impact on database performance, enables fast local reads with low latency in each region, and provides disaster recovery from region-wide outages.

The **Read-Replica Write Forwarding** feature's typical latency is under one second from secondary to primary databases.  This capability enables low latency global reads across your global presence. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a secondary region to take full read-write responsibilities in under a minute.
